# EzVirtualENV
A Simple Program That Makes Making Python Virtual Environments Easy.


## How To Use
> 1) Launch .EXE or run .py file from source code
> 2) Select the path that you would like the virtual environment to be created
> 3) Click "Create Python Virtual Environment!"
> 4) Wait for the virtual environment to be created (Application Will Appear Unresponsive Until Complete)
> 5) A window saying done will pop up
> 6) After clicking done (Or the X), the application will close
Then the virtual environment will be created in the path you selected, along with a activate.bat file which will open cmd and activate the virtual environment without you having to manually do it.

After that you are free to use the virtual environment.
ENJOY!

### About this program
This program is a simple open-source program that I created. If you'd like to take a look at the source code and improve on it (or make fun of it), you can!
Also, the .exe was compiled using auto-py-to-exe.
